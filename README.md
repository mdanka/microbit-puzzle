# Microbit Puzzle

This is a small microbit game consisting of 4 puzzles.

## Teachers' notes

I use this puzzle when introducing the Microbit for the first time. Students have to figure out all solutions themselves, and the fastest ones get a prize (such as a chocolate bar).

The intent is for students to get an idea of some of the possibilities with the Microbit. For this reason, the puzzles use a bunch of the Microbit's abilities: text, animations, buttons, and gestures (should also include accelerometer usage in the future).

Once they have a good idea of the capabilities, they should be more motivated to create their own programs, and will have a better idea of what's possible to build. (Additionally, the code can also serve as an example or a starting point for them.)

## Usage

Either copy the code to the [online MicroPython editor](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html), or use directly the `.hex` file.

## Development notes

This program is at the limit of the Microbit's memory usage. In order to add more content, you will likely have to remove some.
